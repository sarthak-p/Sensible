## Running the Project in Android Studio

To run this project using Android Studio, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    - First, clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this using Git or directly through Android Studio.
    - For Git, use the following command:
      ```
      git clone [URL of the repository]
      ```
    - In Android Studio, go to `File > New > Project from Version Control` and paste the repository URL.

2. **Open the Project**
    - Open Android Studio.
    - Select `Open an existing project` and navigate to the folder where you cloned the project.

3. **Sync the Project with Gradle Files**
    - Android Studio will automatically start syncing the project with the necessary Gradle files. If it doesn’t, you can manually trigger a sync by clicking on `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

4. **Run the Application**
    - Once the sync is complete, you can run the application.
    - Select a device or an emulator to run the project. You can set up an emulator by going to `Tools > AVD Manager` if you don’t have one already.
    - Click on the ‘Run’ button (represented by a green play arrow) or press `Shift + F10` to launch the application.

5. **Troubleshooting**
    - If you encounter any build issues, try cleaning the project by going to `Build > Clean Project` and then rebuild it with `Build > Rebuild Project`.
